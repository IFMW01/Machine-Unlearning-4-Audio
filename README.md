# Machine Unlearning In Audio Analysis For Data Privacy

This code repository contains the implementation for the M.Phil. research project by Israel Mason-Williams. The focus is centered upon implementing unlearning methods that are currently designed for the computer vision domain to audio such that unlearning requests can be satisified in the audio domain. Alongside this novel verification mechanisms are being explored in tandem with novel machine unlearning approaches tailored for audio data. The comprehensive study covers three datasets and architectures to provide a wide overview of the current state of unlearning in audio and potential challenges that exist.
